1.  Where is my payroll information? 
Here is how you can view your payroll information:

- Go to [http://ess.johnshopkins.edu/](http://ess.johnshopkins.edu/) and see the following page, and click "Login": 
<div style="width:200px; height=200px">
![ESS Login](ESS_login.png)
</div>
- Type your JHED Again
- Click "Payroll information" 

`r func(id = "exempt", title = "2.  How do I change my number of dependencies/exemptions?", value = '')`

A [W-4 form](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf) describes the number of dependencies/exemptions you have.  This is important because payroll will tax you differently depending on the number of dependencies.  Dependencies are most commonly children, but you may have other exemptions.  

First, go to your payroll information as described [here](#payroll).  Then 

- Click "Federal and State Withholding"
- Change Exemptions

`r ender`

`r end`

JHU Weekly - union
JHU Semi-Monthly - Most JHSPH people (all students, faculty)
  - fixed number of hours
  hourly rate - how much you get paid per hour (can be different per project)
  hourly position 
    - salary or hourly 
    - have different pay periods
JHHS Biweekly - hospital people

University formula
  - Salary
    - # hours/week  * wage per hour * 52 weeks /24 pay periods =
    10*25*52/24  = 541.6667
  - hourly
    - not each semi-monthly pay period has the same number of "weeks" in it, so even with the same number of hours in each week, you can get different payments depending on the month breakdown.
    - 10*25*52/26 = 500
  - why is this?  Problem is that months are different numbers of days and we choose to do 2 payments per month - numerator doesn't fit evenly into denominator
    - but overall pay is the same.
